The objective of this project is to put into practice the skills to modify and manipulate the DOM. The DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure of the HTML document, which is made up of multiple tags nested one within another, forming a tree of related tags, called the DOM tree, or to simplify DOM.

In Javascript, when we refer to the DOM we refer to this structure, which we can modify dynamically with Javascript: adding new tags, modifying or eliminating others, changing its HTML attributes, adding classes, changing the text content, etc...

### Exercises 

Given an index.html document, the app.js file must modify the DOM in order to:

1. Create a function that removes from the DOM the column that corresponds to the index entered in deleteInput
2. Create a function that creates new div with random size title Hn
3. Create a function that removes the last node without giving error
4. Create a function that applies styles to all columns varying the event


##### REMEMBER: 

Once the progress and flow of the project is finished, you must commit and push the repository remotely, using the following command:

```

$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Message"
$ git push origin repo-remote

```
